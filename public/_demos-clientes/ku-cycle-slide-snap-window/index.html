		The Kú TF1 is a visionary triathlon bike and marks the launch of a unique new bike brand Kú Cycle.
		<br><br>
		Our design philosophy is a journey that always starts with looking for new ways to deliver real athlete performance gains.
		<br><br>
		The complete redesign of the front of the bike without the restriction of rim brakes (as disc brakes were introduced) was a problem worth solving because the front of the bike is the area that influences up to 90% of wind drag for the rider + bike combined.
		<br><br>
		The TF1 is a Formula 1 inspired design where the front of the vehicle is critical to airflow and hence performance of the entire car.
		<br><br>
		Front of the bike<br>
		The Kú TF1 design showcases a striking aerodynamic high fork and head tube tucked between the rider’s arms, which literarily opens up the entire front of the bike. This revolutionary design helps lower overall bike + rider drag due to reduced air-blockage and improved downstream airflow control.
		<br><br>
		A never seen before Steerer Pivot Box eliminates the traditional fork steerer tube to deliver improved front-of-bike stiffness and more direct steering response.
		<br><br>
		The front of bike design also introduces an industry-first frame specific fork length, matching the fork length to each customer frame size, resulting in an optimized rider weight distribution and “feeling one with the bike”.
		<br><br>
		Rider specific<br>
		A second major design philosophy the Kú TF1 introduces, is the frameset being completely optimised to each individual customer, built to order and one hundred percent rider specific.
		<br><br>
		Not only is this athlete centric frame geometry personalised, also the frame paint scheme and logo decals are personalised designs and delivered in an amazing customer experience.
		<br><br>
		In partnership with our network of world class Kú authorised fitters, the Kú TF1 advances every aspect of athlete performance; starting with the rider’s personal biomechanics, bike + rider aero performance, endurance performance stability and even catering to the rider’s personal bike handling skills.
		<br><br>
		The result<br>
		The Kú TF1 delivers major wind drag reductions and a perfect fit between body and machine to significantly improve athlete performance.
		<br><br>
		Our bike designs and performance solutions will change the sport forever.
